This repository is the central location for release management
and governance of the Pyx Julee project.

It does (or will):
 - contains documentation on how releases are managed,
 - describes the process of governing project changes,
 - provides tools for preparing and publishing releases,
 - points to specific versions of the various components
   that make up the project.

The components/ directory contains git submodules
for each of the constituent parts of the project.

It's important to realise that julee is a compositional architecture,
and the submodules are a collecton of Reference Implementations (RI)
versions that work together, to form a RI of the entire architecture.

If you work with this architcture, you may use these FOSS components,
or implement your own versions, or rely on 3rd party services,
or some combination of them all.

The deployment/ directory demonstrates some patterns
of how the architecture may be deployed.
It's supposed to be illustrative, not proscriptive.
Consider them as starting points for people who want
to build and run their own deployment.

The bin/ directory contains scripts for release management.
These are actually the main form of documentation (read the source)
for the release management process; how to update submodules etc.
