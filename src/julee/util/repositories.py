    """Handles storage and retrieval of large files/payloads.

    Architectural Purpose:
    This repository is designed to manage large data payloads that might
    exceed Temporal's payload size limits or are better stored externally.
    It allows workflows to store references to files rather than the files
    themselves, maintaining workflow determinism while handling large data.

        Returns:
            FileMetadata object with details about the uploaded file.

        Implementation Notes:
        - Must be idempotent: uploading the same file_id multiple times is safe.
        - Should return metadata including the actual size and content type.
        - Must perform security validation: file size limits, content type verification, and filename sanitization.
        - Should reject files that don't match declared content type.
