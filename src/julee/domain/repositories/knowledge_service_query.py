"""
KnowledgeServiceQuery repository interface defined as Protocol for the
Capture, Extract, Assemble, Publish workflow.

This module defines the knowledge service query repository protocol.
The repository works with KnowledgeServiceQuery domain objects for
storing and retrieving query configurations that define how to extract
data using external knowledge services.

All repository operations follow the same principles as the sample
repositories:
- Protocol-based design for Clean Architecture
- Type safety with runtime validation
- Idempotent operations
- Proper error handling
- Framework independence

The repository handles the persistence of query definitions including
prompts, assistant prompts, metadata, and service configurations
that are used during the assembly process.
