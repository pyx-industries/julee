"""
FastAPI interface adapters for the julee CEAP workflow system.

This package contains the HTTP API layer that provides external access to the
CEAP (Capture, Extract, Assemble, Publish) workflow functionality.

The API follows clean architecture patterns:
- Request models for external client contracts (API-specific validation)
- Domain models returned directly as responses (no wrapper models needed)
- Dependency injection for use cases and repositories
- HTTPException for error responses with appropriate status codes

Modules:
- requests: Pydantic models for API request validation
- responses: Minimal API-specific response models (health checks, etc.)
- app: FastAPI application setup and endpoint definitions
- dependencies: Dependency injection configuration
