"""Domain models for the shared (core) accelerator.

These models represent the foundational code concepts that julee is built on.
Viewpoint accelerators (HCD, C4) project onto these concepts.

Meta-entities (Entity, UseCase, etc.) define what Clean Architecture artifacts
ARE - their docstrings serve as definitions for doctrine documentation.

Import directly from submodules:
    from julee.core.entities.bounded_context import BoundedContext
    from julee.core.entities.pipeline import Pipeline
