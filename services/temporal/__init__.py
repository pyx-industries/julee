"""
Temporal integration for the julee knowledge service domain.

This package contains Temporal activity and proxy implementations for
knowledge service operations, following the established patterns from
systemPatterns.org.

The package is organized into separate modules to respect Temporal's workflow
sandbox restrictions:

- activities.py: All temporal activity registrations (for worker use only)
  Contains imports from backend service implementations - NOT SANDBOX SAFE

- proxies.py: All workflow-safe proxy classes (for workflow use only)
  Contains no backend imports - SANDBOX SAFE

- activity_names.py: Shared activity name constants - SANDBOX SAFE

IMPORTANT: Do not import everything from __init__.py as this would mix
sandbox-safe and non-sandbox-safe imports. Import directly from the
specific module you need:

- Workers should import from activities.py
- Workflows should import from proxies.py
- Both can import constants from activity_names.py
"""

# This __init__.py intentionally does NOT re-export classes to avoid
# mixing sandbox-safe (proxies) and non-sandbox-safe (activities) imports.
# Import directly from the specific modules instead.

__all__: list[str] = [
    # No re-exports to avoid sandbox violations
    # Import directly from:
    # - .activities for worker use
    # - .proxies for workflow use
    # - .activity_names for constants
]
