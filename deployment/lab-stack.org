#+TODO: TODO WIP | DONE CANCELLED
* WIP lab-stack
- full suite of micro-services with shared infrastructure.

Designed to:
- maximise developer convenience (local stack)
- minimise dev/prod disparities
- capable of full integration testing

This is a single dockerfile that spins up all the component microservices,
but only a single instance of the various backing services
(relational database, object storage, message queue, graph database, etc).
