#+TODO: TODO WIP | DONE CANCELLED
* TODO PaaS-stack
Like the lab-stack, but with minimal shared infrastructure.
Self-hosted model of a production hyperscale deployment,
not including self-hosted LLM or W3C-VC infrastructure.

Designed to:
- simulate a "cloud-native" deployment (that leverages cloud PaaS)
- avoid the burden of self-hosting LLM and W3C-VC services

Basically a bigger, more hairy version of the lab-stack.
It's called PaaS-stack because it simulates a hyper-scale deployment
that a PaaS operator would run, i.e. a PaaS provider
(rather than a PaaS consumer).

Actually, a PaaS provider might start with this deployment pattern
and replace the self-hosted infrastructure with downstream services
(database, object storage, etc), and then replace docker-compose
with a more industrial container orchestration. If that's you,
you know what you are doing and dont need too many hints from us.
