# CI/CD Integration

## Overview
This document describes how the release management scripts integrate with our CI/CD pipeline.

## Release Validation

### Automated Checks
- Workspace validation via check-workspace.sh
- Component version compatibility verification
- Integration test suite execution
- Release artifact generation

### Integration Test Suite
The automated test suite verifies:
- Component compatibility
- End-to-end functionality
- Upgrade paths from previous versions
- Performance benchmarks

Tests run automatically:
- Before release preparation
- During pre-release validation
- On production release candidates

### Release Artifacts
The CI pipeline generates:
- Versioned component containers
- Documentation packages
- Version compatibility matrices
- Upgrade planning tools

## Environment Targets
Each target environment has specific deployment requirements:

### Development
- Automated workspace setup
- Local validation tools
- Component version management

### Staging
- Pre-release validation
- Integration testing
- Performance testing
- Upgrade path verification

### Production
- Release candidate validation
- Production deployment tools
- Rollback procedures
- Monitoring integration

## Automation Workflow
1. Developers run local validation
2. CI triggers on pull requests
3. Automated tests run in staging
4. Release candidates promoted to production
5. Post-deployment validation

## Version Management
- Automated compatibility checking
- Version constraint validation
- Upgrade path generation
- Release announcement automation

## Documentation
- Auto-generated changelogs
- Version compatibility matrices
- Deployment guides per environment
- Release notes templates
