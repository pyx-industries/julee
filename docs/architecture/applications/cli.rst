CLIs
====

CLI applications expose Julee use cases via command-line interfaces, typically using Typer or Click.

CLI commands instantiate and execute use cases directly, or trigger Temporal pipelines for asynchronous operations. CLIs read configuration from environment variables or config files. Common uses include administrative tasks, development and debugging, batch operations, and system initialization.
