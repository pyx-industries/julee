UIs
===

UI applications provide user interfaces for Julee solutions. They interact with the system exclusively through the :doc:`API <api>`—UIs don't have direct access to domain use cases, repositories, services, or Temporal workflows.

Julee is framework-agnostic for UIs. The separation between UI and API means any frontend technology (React, Vue, Svelte, HTMX) can be used.
