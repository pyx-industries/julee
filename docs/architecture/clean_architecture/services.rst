Services
========

**Services do things.**
Not to be confused with :doc:`repositories`, which store things.

A service performs complex operations beyond simple persistence.
Logically, a service might be a shim that delegates to an external actor in the digital supply chain.

Services are defined as :doc:`protocols`;
the :doc:`DI container <dependency_injection>` provides implementations.
