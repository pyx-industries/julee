Applications
============

**Applications are entry points.**

Applications turn :doc:`use cases <use_cases>` into features.
They depend on the :doc:`DI container <dependency_injection>` for repositories and services,
and wire use cases using those dependencies.

Application types include Workers, APIs, CLIs, and UIs.
See :doc:`/architecture/applications/index` for details.
